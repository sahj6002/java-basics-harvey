I have gone back to the basics with this one, because I thought that I might be rushing and not really learning the concepts by heart and logic that I have used, so before proceeding to more advanced concepts, I made some basic projects to practice and enhance my Java knowledge.

What I have Learned
- Learned more String syntax
- Review of basic Java concepts

What I could have Improved
- Input Validation
- Coud've used methods for the grade logic
- Coud've declared subject as a String for more flexibility
