By using what I have learned in the student info analyzer, I made another simple project that helps me practice my java skills without relying as much on online resources except for the syntax of regex(which I have not been able to do prior to this hehe).

## What I have Learned
- Usage of regex(Regular Expression)
- More string syntax

## What I could have Improved
- Coud've made a match() method, to avoid repetitive code
- Coud've also used a do-while loop to make sure to repeat the program if there is an Invalid Input
- More detailed password messaged
