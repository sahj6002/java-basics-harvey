I've dived deeper to the String concepts and made this student info analyzer. The project idea and details are from chat gpt, and I have used some online resources and videos to help me in making this.

## What I have Learned
- Usage of String Methods
- Boolean methods
- The "return" method
- Learned the use of IllegalArgumentException
- Logic and function of StringBuilder and substring
- Static and Non-static variables (did not understand fully before  )
- simple regex

## What I could have Improved
- Simplify countwords by basing on the commas as split()
- More precise Input validation
