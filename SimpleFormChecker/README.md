By combining what I have learned all about strings, I decided to do this simple form checker that shows how much I understand about Java and how much can my skill take me in making a program.

What I have Learned
- Assigning values to Strings
- Pattern and Matcher methods
- IllegalArgumentException

What I could have Improved
- Replaced or improved the use of the isValid boolean
- More improved user-input feedback
