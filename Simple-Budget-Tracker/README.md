This simple expense tracker helped me apply what I've learned in handling user input, working with arrays, and building methods. I also challenged myself to try implementing max and min logic using `Arrays.stream`, with just a little help from AI when I got stuck. It was a cool learning experience and made me feel like I'm leveling up in Java.

## What I learned

- How to store related data using arrays (names and amounts)
- Getting and parsing user input using `Scanner`
- Creating and using a custom method for capitalization
- Using loops to calculate totals and search through arrays
- Using `Arrays.stream()` to get the max and min values

## What I could have Improved

- Could’ve added a search feature to find an expense by name
- Used `double` instead of `int` earlier in input for more accuracy
- Could’ve created a summary class to make the logic more modular
- Enhanced formatting (e.g., rounding to 2 decimal places)
