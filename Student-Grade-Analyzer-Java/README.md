By applying what I’ve learned from previous Java projects, I made a simple grade analyzer that helps calculate a student's average from three scores, convert the result into a letter grade, and determine if the student passed. This helped me solidify how to break problems into smaller methods and practice using basic math and string manipulation in Java.

## What I have Learned
- Using math operations (average formula, score calculations)
- Breaking logic into reusable methods
- Capitalizing full names properly using string methods
- Combining multiple concepts like input, output, conditionals, and formatting

## What I could have Improved
- Could’ve used arrays to allow dynamic score input
- Could’ve validated if input scores are between 0–100
- Might refactor `average()` and `getLetterGrade()` to only run once instead of repeating
