This rock-paper-scissor game is made after the number guessing game, when I have learned about java random I immediately started working on this game as I think they use the same concept of random numbers.
Its also a system that I struggled making alone as I did know how to start, it took me at least 10 minutes of how should I make the game logic because the time of this making I do not know how to assign values to string.
So I researched and asked help for ai, and through this I made the program.

## What I Learned
- For loop
- Usage of try-catch for loading screen (cause I thought it's cool)

## What I Could have Improved
- Simplify the game logic in if-else statement using methods
- Replace the repeated if-else with switch(I already have a basic understanding of switch, I just thought that it's a hussle, although it's actually not)
- User input validation
- Could have simplified the code without the loading screen
