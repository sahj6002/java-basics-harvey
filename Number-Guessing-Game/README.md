This number guessing game have introduced me to much cooler and newer concept that when making, I have to use ai and online resources to do, but in the end learned a lot and have made a simple java system that im proud of :).

## What I learned
- Learned to use java Random
- Do-while loop
- Usage of Java prefixes and Logical Operators
- Learned to keep count using methods

## What I could have Improved
- Coud've created a leaderboard to scores with the previous one
- Use IllegalArgumentException
- Use a public method for the game logic
